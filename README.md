# Battery Simulation App

This project models and optimizes a single battery's operation using:
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for price categorization and forecasting.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) for schedule optimization.

## Features
1. Price categorization (low, normal, peak).
2. Battery state simulation using HMM.
3. Schedule optimization with RL.
4. Short-term price forecasting via HMM.
